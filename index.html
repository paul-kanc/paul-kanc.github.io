    				<h2>Pong</h2>
    				<p>
						This was a project that concluded a 2 week Programming Bootcamp (2020) at City, University of London. Using
						Processing, nI demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the use of classes and 'if' statements. I also showed
						some understanding of how the random function can be used and how physics principles can be recreated.
					</p>
					<p>
						I began by creating the class for the gameplay screen. This consisted of ball movement,collision of the ball with
						the paddles and walls, and the controls for the paddles. To make the ball move, I had to make the x and y
						co-ordinates update by a variable that I named 'speed'. The collision was created using if statements comparing the
						co-ordiantes of the ball and paddles. Finally, I created the menu and victory screans to give some context to the
						game.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was as far as my designs went but I decided to expand on them. I wanted to create an additional gamemode where
						1 player was able to play against the computer. This resulted in me having to create a screen to select the number of
						players and a screen for the player losing. My final addition was having the player select between 3 difficulties
						when they play against the computer. This is where I used randomness to determine how accurate the computer was at
						hitting the ball back. The final step was to add sound to make the game more interesting to play.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					This project taught me the importance of efficient code. After adding sound, I found that it would eventualy start to
    					bug. This was because it would create new sound files everytime I restarted the game using the UI. To fix this, I
    					made sure that the setup method would only run once at the start. Something that I could have improved was the
    					movement of the computer. A times, it would move a lot faster than a player would be able to but it would then miss
    					the ball. This makes it seem like the computer missed on purpose. To make the computer move slower, I would have to
    					increase the delay between the up or down shifts.

    				<h2>Forest Jumper</h2>
    				<p>
						For my 1st year Java project, I have created a platform game with sound. The start of the game will present the user
						with an interface where they can choose between 3 difficulties and whether they want to modify the regular gameplay
						with a low gravity mode. The purpose of the game is to avoid the enemies and collect coins to complete each level.
						The player has 3 lives which will be lost 1 by 1 when they collide with an enemy. The player also has the abilty to
						regain a heart by collecting one in certain levels. Once the player reaches the middle of the game, they have to
						pick up a bomb which allows them to kill enemies. They then have to move back through each level, killing enemies.
						The game is complete when the player gets back to the first level. There is a highscore table at the end if you win.
						The scores are based on the amount of time it takes the player to complete the game. If they want to save their score,
						they can input their name and their score will be saved. At any point during the game, the player can save their
						progress and return by selecting 'load' in the main menu.
