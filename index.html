    					<h2>Pong</h2>
    					<p>
							This was a project that concluded a 2 week Programming Bootcamp (2020) at City, University of London. Using
							Processing, I demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the use of classes and 'if' statements. I also showed
							some understanding of how the random function can be used and how physics principles can be recreated.
						</p>
						<p>
							I began by creating the class for the gameplay screen. This consisted of ball movement, collision of the ball with
							the paddles and walls, and the controls for the paddles. To make the ball move, I had to make the x and y
							co-ordinates update by a variable that I named 'speed'. The collision was created using if statements comparing the
							co-ordiantes of the ball and paddles. Finally, I created the menu and victory screans to give some context to the
							game.
						</p>
						<p>
							This was as far as my designs went but I decided to expand on them. I wanted to create an additional game mode where
							1 player was able to play against the computer. This resulted in me having to create a screen to select the number of
							players and a screen for the player losing. My final addition was having the player select between 3 difficulties
							when they play against the computer. This is where I used randomness to determine how accurate the computer was at
							hitting the ball back. The final step was to add sound to make the game more interesting to play.
    					</p>
    					<p>
    						This project taught me the importance of efficient code. After adding sound, I found that it would eventually start to
    						bug. This was because it would create new sound files every time I restarted the game using the UI. To fix this, I
    						made sure the sound files were only created once in the setup method at the start. Something that I could have
    						improved was the movement of the computer. At times, it would move a lot faster than a player would be able to but it
    						would then miss the ball. This makes it seem like the computer missed on purpose. To make the computer move slower, I
    						would have to increase the delay between the up and down movements.

    					<h2>Forest Jumper</h2>
    					<p>
							This project was completed for a Java module during my 1st year of university. I created a platform
							game with levels, sound, a GUI and a save/load feature. In this project, I demonstarted an understanding of an
							object-oriented language features such as inheritance and encapsulation.
						</p>
						<p>
							I had to import a physic engine provided to me by the university. Then I started by playing around with the basic
							features such as collision to walk on the floor and collect coins. Once I was able to end the game when a level
							was completed, I added villains and increased the number of levels. The villains would remove the player's lives and
							make the player start the level from the beginning if they collide. I also added instructions and the ability to
							pause the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the game was functioning, I wanted to make it more polished. To do this, I added a powerup, sound and a GUI.
							The powerup was a bomb that the player had to pick up to kill the villains. Every time I added a new sound clip, I
							surrounded it with a try-catch block. This was so I could print an exception to the console if there were errors. As
							I was creating the GUI, I decided to add 3 difficulties and a low gravity mode. The difficulties would change the
							speed of the villains and the low gravity mode would edit the simulated gravity.
						</p>
						<p>
							I also added a saving/loading feature and a high score table. If the game is being saved, it would save the necessary
							information to a text file. When loading it back from the main menu, the game would look for that file and read it.
							The high score table would also save and read from a text file. The table is presented when the player finishes the
							game and a score can only be saved at this point. This is because the score is based on how long the player takes to
							finish the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							Something new that I learned from this project was how I can keep my program running even after it encounters an
							error. I used try-catch blocks when introducing sound clips. My game shouldn't have to crash if a sound file wasn't
							found because it's not an error that changes the game drastically. Something that I could have improved was my use
							of comments and the tidiness of my code. When looking over my code during development, I found that I would
							occasionally forget the functions of certain lines. Using comments would have allowed me to create reminders of what
							those lines did. Tidier code would have also made tracking back quicker.
