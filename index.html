    				<h3>Bootcamp 2020: Pong</h3>
    				<p>
						This is my first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). Using Processing, I
						have demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the use of 'if' statements and classes. I have also shown some
						understanding of how randomness can be used and how physics principles can be recreated.
						I began by creating the class that will be used when the game starts. This consisted of the ball having to move,
						bounce off the paddles and the walls, and the movement of the paddles. I then proceeded by creating the main menu and
						the screens once someone has won. I then decided to create an additional gamemode where 1 player is able to play
						against the computer. This resulted in me having to create a screen to select the number of players and a screen for
						the computer winning. My final addition was having the player select between 3 difficulties when they play against
						the computer. This is where I used randomness to determine how accurate the computer was at hitting the ball back.
						The final steps were to add sound to make the game more interesting to play.

    				<h3>Java 2021: Jungle Jumper</h3>
    				<p>
						For my 1st year Java project, I have created a platform game with sound. The start of the game will present the user
						with an interface where they can choose between 3 difficulties and whether they want to modify the regular gameplay
						with a low gravity mode. The purpose of the game is to avoid the enemies and collect coins to complete each level.
						The player has 3 lives which will be lost 1 by 1 when they collide with an enemy. The player also has the abilty to
						regain a heart by collecting one in certain levels. Once the player reaches the middle of the game, they have to
						pick up a bomb which allows them to kill enemies. They then have to move back through each level, killing enemies.
						The game is complete when the player gets back to the first level. There is a highscore table at the end if you win.
						The scores are based on the amount of time it takes the player to complete the game. If they want to save their score,
						they can input their name and their score will be saved. At any point during the game, the player can save their
						progress and return by selecting 'load' in the main menu.
